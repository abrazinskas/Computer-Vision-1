# Computer Vision I materials

This repository contains labratory (practical) works that were conducted for the computer vision I course at the University of Amsterdam. 

## Course description
Digital cameras have become ubiquitous in the form of consumer cameras, webcams, mobile phones, and professional cameras. These cameras yield enormous streams of data and provide the means for communication, observation, and interaction. In this course, image understanding is addressed with the focus on core vision tasks of scene understanding and object recognition.

A broad range of techniques are studied on how computers can understand the visual world of humans including image formation and filtering, features (color and shape invariants, interest point detectors, descriptors, SIFT, HoG), visual information representation (vector space, statistical models, bag-of-words), learning and classification (nearest neighbor, kernel density estimation, SVM), dimension reduction (PCA, LDA and SVD), object detection and classification, object tracking (mean-shift, Kalman), and user interaction (active learning).

This year, different advanced applications in human behavior understanding are studied such as face and emotion recognition, human body analysis and affective computing. Further, we concentrate on object recognition in the field of computer vision. We discuss the data, tasks, and results of Pascal VOC and TRECVID, the leading benchmarks. In addition, we discuss the many derived community initiatives in creating annotations, baselines, and software for repeatable experiments.
